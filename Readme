🎓 Internship Certificate Generation System

This project allows a startup or training platform to manage the internship lifecycle:

1.	Student Application
2.	Admin Task Assignment & Offer Letter Generation
3.	Student Task Submission
4.	Admin Verification & Certificate Generation

🛠 Tech Stack:

	Backend: PHP
	Frontend: HTML + Bootstrap
	Database: MySQL
	PDF Generation: FPDF library
	Server: XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)

🚀 How It Works:

👩‍🎓 1. Student Applies for Internship:

	URL: http://localhost/CertificateSystem/apply.php
	Form collects:
	Full Name
	Email
	College Name
	Course / Domain
	Phone number
Data is stored in internship_applications table in the database.

👨‍💼 2. Admin Dashboard:

	URL: http://localhost/CertificateSystem/admin/dashboard.php
	Admin can:
	    View all student applications
	    Assign tasks
	    Generate & download the Offer Letter PDF
	Offer Letter is saved in: offers/offer_letter_{id}.pdf

Offer Letter Details Include:

	Student Name
	Course/Domain
	Internship Start & End Date
	Assigned Task
	Unique ID (e.g., CS24KE001)

📤 3. Student Submits Completed Task:

	URL: http://localhost/CertificateSystem/submit-task.php
	Student submits:

	Full Name
	College Name
	Course Name
	GitHub Project Link
	LinkedIn Post Link (where offer letter is posted)
	Offer Letter ID
	Task Link
This submission is stored in task_submissions table.

✅ 4. Admin Verifies & Sends Completion Certificate:

	URL: http://localhost/CertificateSystem/generate-certificate.php
    Admin enters:
	    Student Name
	    Certificate ID
	    Internship Start Date
	    Internship End Date
	    Domain / Course Name

Certificate is generated and saved to:

/certificates/certificate_{id}.pdf

FPDF is used to format the certificate with background image and text.
